Sabotage
========

This is the home of the game Sabotage! 

This is a work in progress and will be changing drastically over time.


Issues
========

* Tiles don't highlight when clicked on.
* Add player controls based on mouse clicking.
* Make it so when the player reaches the end, the game ends and application quits.
* Add player movement.
* Fix Box Collider on all of the tiles to fit appropriately. 
* Store more information about the tiles in the custom Tile class. (We can afford it).
