Sabotage
========

This is the home of my game, Sabotage! 

This is a work in progress and will change drastically over time.

Issues
========

* Tiles don't highlight when clicked on.
* Make it so when the player reaches the end, the game ends and application quits. 
* Implement A* to find the shortest path to the selected tile destination.
* Add right click to move to tile and left click to select options on player (like civilization).
